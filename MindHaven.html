            <h2 class = label>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Many individuals aged between 18 - 30 years old do not seek out mental health aid.</p>
            <h3>"Young adults ages 18 to 25 in the U.S have the highest rate of experiencing any mental health concerns (33.7%) compared to adults aged 26 to 49 years,
                 and the highest rate of serious mental illness (11.4%)"</h3>
            <h4>-Forbes Health</h4>
            <h2 class = label>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>MindHaven strives to be an innovative website designed to offer college students and young professionals resources 
                to understand and manage their stress and mental health. 
                It combines educational content with access to professional mental health support, 
                creating a supportive community for navigating the unique challenges
                 of academic and early career pressures. </p>

            <h2 class = label>Our Target Clients</h2>
            <p>As a team we created Assumptive Personas for the client we wanted to target.</p>
            <h3>Main Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> This was a very important factor for us and we chose to target those who fall 
                    in the age range of 18-25 years old. Many times those in this age range either don't have the motivation or 
                    the funding to get aid. Our goals were to help those who may not be well-versed in mental health aid and
                    don't know where to start. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Occupation:</strong>We targeted those who either were still university students or just started 
                a full-time job. Due to the cost of mental health aid many of these individuals in this age range tend to
                avoid seeking help. Our goal was to make a platform that was efficient to use and cost-free to encourage
                alternative ways of help.</li>

            <h2 class = label>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>Our goal was to make an efficient platform that had useful resources.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> We created five main pages that were: Discover, Community,
                    Resources, About, and My Profile. The Discover page is the official main page of the platform, giving 
                    the user a glimpse of the entire application. The Community is a way for the users to connect with others,
                    give them a chance to share their own stories and to have a <strong>social component</STRONG> to the application. 
                    The Reources is the main page for users to explore tools that the platform has to offer, the About 
                    is an introduction to our team and mission statement, and lastly the My Profile allows the users to
                    maintain their profile.
                </li>
            </ul>
                <img src = "images/IAMAP.png" alt = "Photo of the information architecture of the platform">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wireframing:</strong>There were a lot of resources we wanted to implement and we had numerous
                stages of wireframing and drafting. Due to certain pages having to rely on an actual socialization after
            the middle fidelity stage we ended up focusing mainly on our Discover and Resources Pages. The goal was to contain all the
        information without overwhelming our users. We also wanted to emphasize the ability to take an assesment for a personalized
        solution." </li>
            </ul>
            <div class = "wireframecontain">
                <img src = "images/MindHaven Wireframe (1)-1.png" alt = "First wireframe of platform">
                <img src = "images/MindHaven Wireframe-1.png" alt = "Second wireframe of platform">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong>After creating a working prototype of our Discover and Resources pages we began
                to do Usability testing. We used snowball sampling to gather people interested in testing the product. We created a protocol
            that contained charts to help ensure that important components were functioning properly. After this testing we put together
            a presentation of key findings and possible fixes. The biggest findings were the length of informaiton on the Discover Page and
            also the navigation bar as it was having some glitch issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class = evolution>
            <h2 class = "label">The Key Changes</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Removing Distracting Elements</strong>In the first few phases of wireframing we had a lot of content we wanted to showcase.
                    Because of the amount of content some of the indivudlas who did our usability testing stated that it was a bit overwhelming. Therefore,
                we decided to scale down on the amount of information and create a layout that still showcases various componenets but doesn't overwhelm
            the user.</table></li>
            </ul>
            <img src = "images/DiscoverPageBefore.png" alt = "Discover Page of Platform prior to changes">
            <img src = "images/DiscoverPageAfter.png" alt = "Discover Page of Platfrom after changes">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong>Understanding that our platform would have various pages, during our lowfi and midfi wireframes
                we didn't consider utilizing breadcrumbs in navigation. However, by the final wireframe we decided it would help to keep users
            informed of where they are on the applicaiton at all times. Allowing our users to feel control over their navigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src = "images/breadcrumbnav.png" class = "breadcrumbimg" alt = "BreadCrumb Navigation">
        </div>
        <div class = "Changes">
            <h2 class = "label">Concerns and Changes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Aspect:</strong>This was highly asked for from our Usability testers, however, with time constraints we were unable to have a functioning 
                community forum prototype. What this would entail would be that users of this application would be able to ask questions, look for friends, and make their own blog posts.
            This would allow them to feel a sense of community on our platform. Currently we had only been able to implement interactive individual componenets
        such as having access to podcasts and music playlists.</li>
                 <li><strong>Professional Advice Concerns:</strong>This was highly asked for from our Usability testers, however, with time constraints we were unable to have a functioning 
            community forum prototype. What this would entail would be that users of this application would be able to ask questions, look for friends, and make their own blog posts.

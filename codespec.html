            <h2 class = label>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Codespec is an application that strives to create a more inclusive enviornment <br>
                for beginner programmers. Typically the demographics of programming are:
            </p>
            <h3>80.1% Male <br>
                19.9% Women <br>
                "The most common race/ethnicity for Computer programmers is White"</h3>
            <h4>-DATAUSA: Computer Programmers </h4>
            <h2 class = label>Our Tasks</h2>
            <p>I worked in a team of five others including me and we worked directly with our client. <br>
                Our team name was: <strong>MIKAD</strong> and the project timeline was: <br>
                <li>Creating Interaction Maps</li>
                <li>Conducting Usability Tests</li>
                <li>Creating and Deploying Surveys</li>
                <li>Creating a Comparative Evaluation with Eight Competitors</li>
                <li>Create a Heuristic Evaluation</li>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "methods">
            <h2 class = label>Interaction Maps</h2>
            <p>As a team we created an Interaction map that allowed us to gain insights on the three main type of users of the application.
                <br> We documented the different abilities and functionalities of each user type and created a map of screenshots and arrows. 
                <br> Unfortunately due to confidentiatlity that map cannot be shown.
            </p>
            <h3>Main User Insights:</h3>
            <p>There are three types of users for Codespec, the Learner, Researcher and Instructor.</p>
                <h3><strong>Learner Insights</strong></h3>
                        <img src = "images/learnerinsights.png" class = first alt = "Image containing text of learner insights">
                        <img src = "images/learnerinsightcontinued.png" class = second alt = "Image containing text of learner insights">
                <h3><strong>Researcher Insights:</strong></h3>
                        <img src = "images/researcherinsights.png" class = first alt = "Image containing text of Researcher insights">
        </div>
        <div class = "approach">
            <h2 class = label>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>Because the platform has three main types of users we had to conduct usability testing for each user type.</p>
            <img src = "images/overviewofUT.png" alt = "Photo of Usability Testing methods">
            <p>Due to the different user types we decided to conduct three tests for the Learner and two tests for the <br>
            Researcher and Instructor. We conducted all of our Usability Testing over Zoom in order to record with consent and obtain <br>
        a transcript. Our reasoning for doing the amount of tests was because our client specifically wanted to know more about the User Experience for the Learner <br>
    therefore, we dedicated the majority of tests for that user type. We created separate questions that we had pre-prepared for our tests and also had the users interact with the platform.</p>
                <h3><strong>The Learner</strong></h3>
                    <img src = "images/learnerUT.png" alt = "Photo of Learner usability testing findings and recommendations">
                    <p>For the three Learner tests that we conducted, the programming experience of each individual ranged from not knowing any type of programming <br>
                    to having some experience of programming. We wanted to ensure we got a diverse set of programming knowledge in order to gain better insights of user experience. <br>
                As captured above we had quite a few findings through our testing and we created recommendations based off these findings. </p>
                <h3><strong>The Instructor/Researcher</strong></h3>
                    <img src = "images/i_rUT.png" alt = "Photo of Researcher and Instructor usability testing findings and recommendations">
                    <p>For the two Researcher/Instructor tests that we conducted, because the functionalities of each user type were very similar we decided to group the findings and recommendations together. <br>
                     The individuals that we had participate both had extensive knowledge of programming and experience teaching others how to program in order to gain the most insightful findings. As captured above <br>
                    we also had findings and recommendations for our client based on our testing. </p>
                <h3><strong>The Overall Results</strong></h3>
                    <img src = "images/summaryUT.png" alt = "Photo of Learner usability testing findings and recommendations">
                    <p>In order to better navigate our findings we also combined our findings of all usability testing and mentioned our key findings and reccomendations.  </p>

            <h2 class = "label">Creating and Deploying a Survey</h2>
            <p>The client specifically asked for us to find insights over the user type of the Learner, therefore, we created a survey instrument in order to gage different areas of the application. The survey primarily revolves around
                questions over programming experience and feelings of marginalization within the programming community. The creation of these questions not only gave us insight on target users but also helped us better understand how to better implement
                IDEAS+ within the platform. <br>
            </p>
            <img src = "images/surveyone.png" alt = "Image of the survey information">
            <img src = "images/surveytwo.png" alt = "Image of the survey information">

        <div class = "evolutioncodespec">
            <h2 class = "label">Comparative Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Our team went ahead and created a Comparative Evaluation matrix in order to gage what features seem to be reoccuring in other programming platforms. 
                Having this information we were better able to formulate what changes and implementations might benefit the platform more.
            </p>

                <img src = "images/CEone.png" alt = "Image of Comparative Evaluation">

                <img src = "images/CEthree.png" alt = "Image of Comparative Evaluation">
            </ul>
            <p>We went ahead and compared Codespec to eight other platforms. These comparisons were either based on similar functionality of platforms or simialr content of
                platforms. Captured above is our analysis, findings and competitors. 
            </p>

        <div class = "evolutioncodespec">
            <h2 class = "label">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
            <p>As our final step we conducted a Heuristic Evaluatin according to Nielsen's heuristics. Thorough this process we were able to 
                analyze the details of the platforms and some issues that might come up for users while utilizing the platform. For the rating of each issue we followed
                a scale of 0-5 which is described in the attachment below.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "label">Reflection of Project</h2>
            <p>Through this project and working with this client I gained a lot of insight as a researcher and designer. I was able to interact
                and maintain great relations with many different individuals. There were a lot of limitations in our project timeline such as gathering more diverse
                population samples for usability testing and surveys. However, overall we were able to analyze and conclude all of our research for each section 
                in workpapers and present them in front of other prospective target users and for our client. This platform is a great platform and the goal of the platform
                to ensure that programming is a safe space for all others is one of the reasons why I love to be in UIUX.

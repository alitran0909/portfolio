            <h2 class = label>Overview</h2>
            <p>As an intern I worked directly with the director of the therapy clinic and also worked with four other interns. With the clinic being based
                in Madrid, a lot of work was in Spanish and English. Our tasks as interns included a lot of research over therapy and mental health topics,
                utilizing this research we would write reports, create infographics, and create pdocasts. Our primary goal for the clinic was to create interactive content
                in order to aid clients and to garner potential clients.
            </p>
            <h2 class = label>Infographics</h2>
            <p>Every week we would have team meetings with our director, and we would have to choose a mental health topic we would like to focus on to make an infographic for.
                I created my infographics using the platform Canva and would make two each week, one in English and one in Spanish. The topics that I focused on were: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural Adaptation:</strong>I chose this topic to be my first because I had just moved to Madrid, Spain and I had never
                lived in another country at this point in my life. With culture in Spain being very different compared to the US, I had to take some time to adjust,
            moreover, thankfully I have extensive knowledge in Spanish, but still I wasn't a native speaker. So I began to question how others in my position
        were coping with their envionrments and how it was affecting their mental health. Cultural Adaptation embodies this sentiment as it explains the phases
    an indiviudal typically goes through whilst adapting to a new culture. </li>
            </ul>

            <img src = "images/CAESP.png" class = espinfo alt = "Infographic of Cultural Adaptation in Spanish">
            <ul><li><strong>Body Image:</strong>During this week our director had specifically asked her to focus on a topic that related to a person's physical health and relation to their diet. 
            Therefore, I chose to do Body Image, the representation of body images in media and how to improve one's sense of Body Image</li></ul>
            <img src = "images/BIENG.png" class = enginfo alt = "Infographic of Body Image in English">
            <img src = "images/BIESP.png" class = espinfo alt = "Infographic of Body Image in Spanish">
            <ul><li><strong>LGBTQIA+ Rights:</strong>Because I was staying in Spain during Pride Month I had expressed wanting to make an infographic about 
            LGBT rights.</li></ul>
            <img src = "images/LGBTENG.png" class = enginfo alt = "Infographic of LGBT Rights">
            <img src = "images/LGBTESP.png" class = espinfo alt = "Infographic of LGBT Rights in Spanish">
            <ul><li><strong>Bisexual Erasure:</strong>I had created this infographic due to the issues of many Bisexual Indiviudals feeling like 
            their sexuality was being neglected.</li></ul>
            <img src = "images/ERASEENG.png" class = enginfo alt = "infographic of Bisexual Erasure">
            <img src = "images/ERASUREESP.png" class = espinfo alt = "infographic of Bisexual Erasure in Spanish">
            <ul><li><strong>Professional Identity:</strong>For our final week our director had given up each a topic related to 
            jobs.</li></ul>
            <img src = "images/PIENG.png" class = enginfo alt = "Infographic of Professional Identity">
            <img src = "images/PIESP.png" class = espinfo alt = "Infographic of Professional Identity Spanish">

        <div class = "methods">
            <h2 class = label>Reports</h2>
            <p>Our team was also tasked to write 1000+ word reports on each topic that we had chosen or were given.
                Therefore, these reports were due every week and we had to conduct research on each topic to write out an extensive report
                that was designated to teach our clients about each topic. Besides the reports we also had to write
                out instructions and appropiate steps to find help.

            <h2 class = label>Podcast</h2>
            <p>Alongside my internship I was also taking a cultural psychology class, and because there
            was a lot of overlaps in content my group and I decided to also contribute a podcast for the clinic and our course.
        Therefore, this podcast was hosted on Vox a Spanish platform for podcasts and we conducted semi-structured interviews with national
    and international indviduals living in Spain. Our primariy goal with this platform was to observe and ask about living expereinces 
and how it affected an individual's mental health. We also had podcasts that focused on our own group members mental health.  </p>

            <h2 class = "label">Research Project</h2>
            <p>Throughout, my entire time at my internship I was also tasked from the beginning to work on an overarching research project.
                Because I had never lived in another country before this internship I chose the topic of <strong>Cultural Adaptation</strong>. For the research project
                I utilzied a lot of prior research papers, I conducted semi-structured interviews, and used SPSS to transform numerical data. By the end of all of my research I had put together
                a research paper and presentation. I was able to present to a board of doctors and psychology professors in Spain over my research.

            <h2 class = "label">Reflection</h2>
            <p>I hold this internship very closely to my heart. Through this internship I had felt more prone into going into the UIUX field. From this internship
                I had condcuted a lot of research for my clinic and how to improve the current mental health offerings of the clinic. Through this it had sparked my interest
                to see what other areas of research I could contribute to. Moreover, because I had an extensive background in technology I wanted to combine these two interests and that's how I decided to pursue
                my Master's in Information Science.
